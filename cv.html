                    <ul>
                        <li>Error recognition: Studied and used supervised learning models in order to recognize
                            patterns of error from
                            users gestures (supervised multilabel classification).

                        <li>
                            User modeling: Studied and developed a framework where users are represented in a
                            multidimensional metric space, making it possible to extract a personalized learning path
                            and monitor the evolution of users' profiles over time.

                        <li>
                            Adaptation: From user modeling, adaptation of action selection can be seen as a multi-armed
                            bandit problem. Proposed and implemented a contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm to make a
                            system automatically and dynamically adapt to the user over time. This work has been
                            published
