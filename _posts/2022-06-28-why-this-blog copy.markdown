<p>I think <em>writing is incredibly helpful</em> to take a step back on your work and your understanding of things, organize your thoughts and see what you understood and what you must keep on studying.</p>

<p>These last years I have written many reports and presentations, and I have also written pieces that I never shared only for the sake of taking this step back on my thoughts. With this blog I want to force myself into <em>writing more often</em> and share some pieces of information that might end up useful for someone else.</p>
